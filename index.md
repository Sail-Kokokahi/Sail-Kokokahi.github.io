## Overview
<hr>
Sail Kokokahi is a social/recreation club established in 2022 as a way to establish contact among people who share the love of recreational boat sailing. They are located at Kaneohe Bay on Oahu, Hawaii and need a way to enforce their "Work, Play, Pay" policy. This policy was designed to ensure that each and every member of the club contributes to the clubs growth through social engagement and volunteer work. Each member is expected to meet the annual quota of 6 hours through work such as:

- Approved activities such as maintenance projects or club clean-up days (1.5hrs per event)
- Volunteering at club events (1hr per event)
- Helping organize social activities (1hr per event)
- 
If members do not meet the quota of 6 hours they will be billed at 20 dollars per unfulfilled hour. The problem with enforcing this policy resides in the members volunteer hours being tracked manually. Some members are unsure if they have met the quota for the year while others are not fulfilling the commitment at all.

To solve this problem, our team will work torwards making a web application to mangage and monitor the volunteer hours contributed by each club member. The web application will enable members to monitor their own volunteer hours and allow administrators to track and automate the billing process for members with unfulfilled volunteer hours.
